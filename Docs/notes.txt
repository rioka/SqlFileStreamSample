LocalDb does not support FILESTREAM

You cannot enable FILESTREAM on a 32-bit version of SQL Server running on a 64-bit operating system.

To enable and change FILESTREAM settings
- On the Start menu, point to All Programs, point to SQL Server 2016, point to Configuration Tools, and then click SQL Server Configuration Manager.
- In the list of services, right-click SQL Server Services, and then click Open.
- In the SQL Server Configuration Manager snap-in, locate the instance of SQL Server on which you want to enable FILESTREAM.
- Right-click the instance, and then click Properties.
- In the SQL Server Properties dialog box, click the FILESTREAM tab.
- Select the Enable FILESTREAM for Transact-SQL access check box.
- If you want to read and write FILESTREAM data from Windows, click Enable FILESTREAM for file I/O streaming access. Enter the name of the Windows share in the Windows Share Name box.
- If remote clients must access the FILESTREAM data that is stored on this share, select Allow remote clients to have streaming access to FILESTREAM data.
- Click Apply.
- In SQL Server Management Studio, click New Query to display the Query Editor.
- In Query Editor, enter the following Transact-SQL code:
  
    EXEC sp_configure filestream_access_level, 2
    RECONFIGURE
  
- Click Execute.
- Restart the SQL Server service.

Best Practices
- Physical Configuration and Maintenance
  + When you set up FILESTREAM storage volumes, consider the following guidelines:
  + Turn off short file names on FILESTREAM computer systems. Short file names take significantly longer to create. To disable short file names, use the Windows fsutil utility.
  + Regularly defragment FILESTREAM computer systems.
  + Use 64-KB NTFS clusters. Compressed volumes must be set to 4-KB NTFS clusters.
  + Disable indexing on FILESTREAM volumes and set disablelastaccess To set disablelastaccess, use the Windows fsutil utility.
  + Disable antivirus scanning of FILESTREAM volumes when it is not unnecessary. If antivirus scanning is necessary, avoid setting policies that will automatically delete offending files.
  + Set up and tune the RAID level for fault tolerance and the performance that is required by an application.
  
Physical Database Design
- When you design a FILESTREAM database, consider the following guidelines:
  + FILESTREAM columns must be accompanied by a corresponding uniqueidentifier ROWGUID column. These kinds of tables must also be accompanied by a unique index. Typically this index is not a clustered index. If the databases business logic requires a clustered index, you have to make sure that the values stored in the index are not random. Random values will cause the index to be reordered every time that a row is added or removed from the table.
  + For performance reasons, FILESTREAM filegroups and containers should reside on volumes other than the operating system, SQL Server database, SQL Server log, tempdb, or paging file.
  + Space management and policies are not directly supported by FILESTREAM. However, you can manage space and apply policies indirectly by assigning each FILESTREAM filegroup to a separate volume and using the volume's management features.
